## WebAppHost ##

This repository contains the project `WebAppHost`, which is a hosting solution for [Microsoft Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) and [SignalR](http://signalr.net/).

Both Microsoft Web API and SignalR both provide a self-hosting solution, but they are not easily compatible with each other. This assembly provides a self-hosting
solution that supports both.

Currently, the best way to understand how to use this assembly is to look at the sample application.
